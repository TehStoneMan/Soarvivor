Soarvivor
=========

A Minecraft mod to implement the ruleset from PaulSoarsJr's Man Vs Minecraft video series

Features include:

 * Configurable "limited-stack" size - defaults to 16
     This will limit the size of item-stacks in the player's inventory. Does not effect chests or other containers.

 * Makeshift quiver craftable form leather boots and two pieces of string
     The quiver can hold two "limited-stacks" of arrows. Right-click with the quiver in your hand to open the gui interface. When using the bow, arrows will be automatically drawn from the quiver.

 * Hydration bar
     An extra stat bar above the food bar that shows the current level of the player's hydration as a series of full/half/empty bottle icons. Can also show the player's "Coldness" level as iced-over versions of the bottle icons.

 * Drinking from a water bottle increases the player's hydration

To Do:
======

* Include hydration increase to other consumable items
* Activity decreases hydration
* Biome effects hydration/coldness
* Proximity to heat sources
* Limit the player's inventory to one line + the hot bar
* Limit the stack size in the player's inventory
