=========

A Minecraft mod to implement the ruleset from PaulSoarsJr's Man Vs Minecraft video series

Features include:

 * Configurable "limited-stack" size - defaults to 16
     This will limit the size of item-stacks in the player's inventory. Does not effect chests or other containers.
 
 * Limited player inventory
     Player inventory is limited to only the hotbar and the lowest row.

 * Makeshift quiver craftable form leather boots and two pieces of string
     The quiver can hold two "limited-stacks" of arrows. Right-click with the quiver in your hand to open the gui interface. When using the bow, arrows will be automatically drawn from the quiver.

 * Hydration bar
     An extra stat bar above the food bar that shows the current level of the player's hydration as a series of full/half/empty bottle icons. Can also show the player's "Coldness" level as iced-over versions of the bottle icons.

 * Drinking and eating certain food items and potions increases the player's hydration
 
 * Hot biomes decrease the player's hydration
 
 * Cold biomes can freeze the player, warm biomes restores the player's body tempreture
 
 * Proximity to heat sources (fire, lava) warms the player.

To Do:
======

* Apply the limited player inventory to other comtainers.

Future Ideas:
=============
(NOTE: These may not be implemented)

* Canoe - Double length boat that can carry a passenger
* Canteen - Uncraftable item that carries 8x water bottle
* Pro quiver - Uncraftable quiver that carries 4x limited-stacks of arrows
