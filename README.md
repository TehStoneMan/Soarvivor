Soarvivor
=========

A Minecraft mod to implement the ruleset from PaulSoarsJr's Man Vs Minecraft video series

Features include:

 * Configurable "limited-stack" size - defaults to 16
     This will limit the size of item-stacks in the player's inventory. Does not effect chests or other containers.

 * Makeshift quiver craftable form leather boots and two pieces of string
     The quiver can hold two "limited-stacks" of arrows. Right-click with the quiver in your hand to open the gui interface. When using the bow, arrows will be automatically drawn from the quiver.

 * Hydration bar
     An extra stat bar above the food bar that shows the current level of the player's hydration as a series of full/half/empty bottle icons. Can also show the player's "Coldness" level as iced-over versions of the bottle icons.

 * Drinking and eating certain food items and potions increases the player's hydration
 
 * Hot biomes decrease the player's hydration
 
 * Cold biomes can freeze the player, warm biomes restores the player's body tempreture
 
 * Proximity to heat sources (fire, lava) warms the player.

To Do:
======

* Limit the player's inventory to one line + the hot bar
* Limit the stack size in the player's inventory
